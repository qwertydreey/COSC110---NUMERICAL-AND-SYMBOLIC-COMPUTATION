Laboratory Activity #3: Introduction to SymPy
Objective:
To explore symbolic computation using the SymPy library in Python. The activity covers basic calculations, symbolic representation, simplification, and expansion of algebraic expressions.

Task 1: Importing Required Modules
The activity begins by importing all necessary functions and classes from the SymPy library. This setup step ensures that all symbolic operations such as simplification, expansion, square root evaluation, and rational number handling can be performed seamlessly.

Task 2: Basic Calculations
Two expressions involving square roots and rational numbers are evaluated symbolically. Unlike standard numerical operations, symbolic calculations preserve exact values and mathematical form, allowing for more accurate algebraic manipulation.

The first expression involves the addition of a rational number and a square root divided by a constant.

The second expression multiplies two square roots, one of which is expressed as a rational number.

These calculations demonstrate SymPy's ability to maintain precision and expressiveness without converting results into decimal approximations.

Task 3: Creating Symbolic Variables
Symbolic variables are created to represent algebraic symbols such as x and y. These variables are foundational to symbolic computation, allowing equations and expressions to be constructed and manipulated just as they would be in algebra.

Task 4: Simplification of Expressions
Algebraic expressions are simplified using symbolic rules. For example:

A quadratic expression divided by a binomial is reduced to its simplest form.

A more complex rational expression is simplified to a compact equivalent.

This step showcases SymPy's capability to recognize patterns and apply algebraic identities automatically.

Task 5: Expansion of Expressions
Polynomial expressions are expanded to express the equations in their fully multiplied form. This is useful for:

Verifying factored expressions

Distributing terms

Preparing expressions for further simplification or solving

Expanding also aids in understanding how different parts of an equation interact when multiplied or combined.
